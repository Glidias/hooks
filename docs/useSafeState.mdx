This hook is used in the same way as React.useState, expect that calling `setState` after the component is unmounted has no effect rather than throwing an error.

## API

```ts
function useSafeState<S>(
  initialState: S | (() => S)
): readonly [state: S, setState: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<S>>];

function useSafeState<S = undefined>(): readonly [
  state: S | undefined,
  setState: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<S | undefined>>
];
```

## Example

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useSafeState } from "@lilib/hooks";

function Example() {
  const [data, setData] = useSafeState<any>();

  useMount(() => {
    fetch("http://example.com/api/getData").then((response) => {
      setData(response.json());
    });
  });

  ...
}
```
