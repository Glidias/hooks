```

import React, { forwardRef, useRef } from "react";
import { useComposedRef } from "@lilib/hooks";

const Component = forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, any>((props, ref) => {
  const domRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const composedRef = useComposedRef(domRef, ref);

  // Do somthing.

  return <div ref={composedRef}>...</div>;
});
```
