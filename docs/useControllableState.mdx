The state returned by this hook can be controlled by `controlledState` parameter. If `controlledState` is not `null` and `undefined`, means the state of this hook is controlled, the returned state is exactly the same as `controlledState`, and calling the `setState` method has no effect. This hook is useful when developing form components.

## API

```ts
function useControllableState<S>(
  defaultState: S,
  controlledState?: S
): readonly [state: S, setState: (newState: S) => void];

function useControllableState<S = undefined>(): readonly [
  state: S | undefined,
  setState: (newState?: S | undefined) => void
];
```

## Example

<ExampleBlock>
  <Example />
</ExampleBlock>
<CodeBlock language="tsx">{ExampleCode}</CodeBlock>
